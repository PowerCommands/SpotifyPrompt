## Prerequisites

- **.NET 9.0 SDK** installed.
- A **Spotify Developer** account with a registered application:  
  [Register here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
  
  You will need:
  - **Client ID**
  - **Redirect URI** (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/callback/`)

- Store your **Client ID** securely using the built-in Security module:

   ```bash
   secret --create "spotify_prompt"
   ```
- Ollama Service

  The Spotify Prompt Client uses AI with Ollama and Gemma3 to get related artists, since Spotify removed the Get Artist's Related Artists in their WebAPI. You can download this software here: https://ollama.com/download it is a lightweight service running in the background.
  You CAN USE this client without it, but some of itÂ´s functionality regarding building playlists will not work.

## Workflow Example

1. **Login** to Spotify:

   ```bash
   login
   ```

2. **Update and list your playlists**:

   ```bash
   list --update
   list
   ```

3. **Control playback**:

   ```bash
   play
   next
   pause
   ```

4. **Search tracks and build playlists**:

   ```bash
   append
   search track --artist queen
   build
   ```

5. **Use AI enrichment**:

   ```bash
   ai
   artist --ai
   ```

## Notes

- **Session selections**: You can accumulate selected tracks, albums, and artists across commands (search, album, artist) and operate on them, just turn on append if you want to accumulate your selection that could be use when building a playlist with `build` command.
- **AI Integration**: Integrates with a local or remote AI server (Ollama) for artist enrichment and tagging.
- **Backup**: Important Spotify data is persisted and can be backed up at any time.
- **Automatic Token Handling**: No manual refresh needed; tokens are refreshed automatically when needed.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the **Redirect URI** registered in Spotify Dashboard matches your configuration exactly.
- If the access token expires and refresh fails, run `login` again.
- Update your Spotify application scopes if you encounter permission issues.

**Enjoy controlling Spotify directly from your terminal!**
